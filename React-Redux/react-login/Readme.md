# Changes

- Mobily Friendly support (via `viewport`)
- Team support (via _BEM_ classes)
- Improved UX (via animation)
- Improved Web Accessibility
- Improved DX (added arrow functions to avoid `bind.this`)
- Improved maintainability (via `defaultProps` & `propTypes`)
- Added internationalization
- `HomePage` unit tests have been updated
- Unit tests for new components (`Alert`, `NotFoundPage`) have been provided
- Lint issues have been addressed

# Notes

- Task Description has incorrect endpoints
- Error text: `Username "asd" is already taken` is good for UX but is bad for security - it's an opportunity for bruteforce attack.
- Achieved Lighthouse results:
  - Performance 100%
  - PWA 46% (out of scope)
  - Accessibility 100%
  - Best Practice 93% (will be 100% on prod env with H2)
  - SEO 100%
